# Tik Tac Toe
## MIT React Codio Exercise
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to refactor an ATM app to improve UI and add verification. I added functionality to disable the submit button if a withdrawal request is larger than the account balance and hide the amount and submit options until the user selects which option (deposit or withdrawal) they want to use.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Fork repository and download to local device. Load folder onto local server and select HTML file to render app.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will add more style to the app inluding color, spacing, and font changes.<br>
