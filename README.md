# React Tik Tac Toe
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to design a tik tak toe game that tracks each player's turn and symbol, focusing on child and parent relationships in React components. I added functionality to display which player's turn it is on the board, color code the Xs and Os, and display a message when player has won the game.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Fork repository and download to local device. Npm install React and launch on local server.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will turn the "winner is player ___" message into a pop-up over the board and prevent any more boxes from being played. This could be accomplished by unmounting the squares and mounting a single 600x600 square component on the board with the message displaying which player won the game.<br>
